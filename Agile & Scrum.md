### Scrum Sprint Cycle
Typically a 2 week cycle. A short interval of time that you can go off and work on project and then get back together.


Dev team - 3 to 9 people that should have all the things they need.

Scrum master - Coach that serves the team. Negotiates with product owner. Keeps team on track. Manages the sprint backlog.

Product owner - Someone who represents the client. Keeps track of what the client needs. Manages the Product backlog

#### Scrum Master

Visualize your work. Keep track of what is done and what needs to be done. 

Done - What is done? You need to know what does it mean to be done with a feature.


#### Testing

Testing is a huge part of the scrum cycle. There are many different types of testing.
