# Wyncode Notes

These are all of my notes for the full stack program at Wyncode. All of the lectures are seperate markdown files, except when lectures are broken into seperate parts on the same topic. Those are all in the same markdown file. As and example "Wk1 - Intro to CSS" was actually two lectures, Intro to CSS part 1 and Intro to CSS part 2.

If you have anything you would like to add feel free to open a pull request! :)

Also if you need help with anything feel free to slack me or submit an issue and I can help you ( if I can haha).
